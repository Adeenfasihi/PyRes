This code implements simple, resolution-based theorem provers for
first-order logic. 

prover01.py
===========

This is the simplest example of a prover for the clausal fragment of
first-order logic. It implements the basic given-clause loop with
first-in-first-out clause selection and without any redundancy
elimination.


prover02.py
===========

This version of the prover processes the same logic as prover01.py,
but adds some performance-enhancing features. This include better
clause selection heuristics, subsumption, and negative literal
selection. 



prover03.py
===========

This prover adds a simple clausifier, so it is able to process full
first-order logic. Otherwise, it is similar to prover02.

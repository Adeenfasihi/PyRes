first-order logic. It is released as free software under the GNU GPL

pyres-simple.py
===============

This is the simplest example of a prover for the clausal fragment of
first-order logic. It implements the basic given-clause loop with
first-in-first-out clause selection and without any redundancy
elimination.

Suggested command line:
./pyres-simple.py EXAMPLES/PUZ002-1.p

PUZ001-1.p is quite hard for pyres-simple!


pyres-cnf.py
===========

This version of the prover processes the same logic as
pyres-simple.py, but adds some performance-enhancing features. This
include better clause selection heuristics, subsumption, and negative
literal selection.

Suggested command line:
./pyres-cnf.py -tfb -HPickGiven5 -nsmallest EXAMPLES/PUZ001-1.p

pyres-fof.py
===========

This prover adds a simple clausifier, so it is able to process full
first-order logic. It also will detect the use of equality, and add
equality axioms. Otherwise, it is similar to pyres-cnf.py.


Suggested command line:
./pyres-fof.py -tfb -HPickGiven5 -nlargest EXAMPLES/PUZ001+1.p

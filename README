This code implements simple, resolution-based theorem provers for
first-order logic. 

prover01.py
===========

This is the simplest example of a prover for the clausal fragment of
first-order logic. It implements the basic given-clause loop with
first-in-first-out clause selection and without any redundancy
elimination.

Suggested command line: 
./prover01.py EXAMPLES/PUZ002-1.p

PUZ001-1.p is quite hard for prover01!


prover02.py
===========

This version of the prover processes the same logic as prover01.py,
but adds some performance-enhancing features. This include better
clause selection heuristics, subsumption, and negative literal
selection. 

Suggested command line: 
./prover02.py -tfb -HPickGiven5 -nsmallest EXAMPLES/PUZ001-1.p

prover03.py
===========

This prover adds a simple clausifier, so it is able to process full
first-order logic. Otherwise, it is similar to prover02. 


Suggested command line: 
./prover03.py -tfb -HPickGiven5 -nlargest EXAMPLES/PUZ001+1.p
